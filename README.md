The sky language
================

Sky is an imperative C family language with some functional features, inluding first class functions, closure and variant types.  
It's purpose is not to be used in production.  
Sky is a toy language created for me to practise writing a whole compiler, including a hand written parser, solid semantic analysis, hopefully some optimizations and a x64 backend.  


In the cpp folder, you will find the sky compiler reference implementation, which is (obviously) written in C++.  
At the moment, the compiler only features a lexer generated by re2c and an almost feature complete hand written parser, as well as a DOT file dumper.  
From the DOT file, Graphviz can be used to generate an image of the AST.  

Features
========

Namespaces, templated types and functions, operator overloading, defer blocks, if-else expression, exec block expression.  
Types declarations can be structures, aliases or variants (which are oversets of enums).
